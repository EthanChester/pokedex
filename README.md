# Simple React.js Pokedex project

Provides a UI to view the 151 original pokemon.
Includes additional information on clicking each pokemon and searching functionality based on name and number.

My code is in the App.jsx, DetailsModal.jsx, PokemonInfo.jsx and App.css files in the src folder, everything else is from initialising the react project.

## To run the project:

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

then

### `npm start`
